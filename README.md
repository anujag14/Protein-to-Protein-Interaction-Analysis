# Protein-to-Protein-Interaction-Analysis
This study presents a graph-based ML approach to predict cancer-related proteins using PPI networks. Key topological features feed classifiers (RF, SVM, XGBoost), with XGBoost achieving ~89% accuracy. SHAP highlights feature importance, and network analysis reveals disease modules, advancing cancer biomarker discovery.
